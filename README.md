make_sign_stills.py is adapted from this script: https://github.com/borstell/make_sign_stills
cut_tiers.py allows you to create clips automatically of all the annotations on a given tier in an eaf file 
cropt_videos.py automatically crops part of the video and removes any audio

These are part of my workflow for the Egyptian Sign Language documentation project: glossed lexical items can be clipped to be uploaded for the corpus (egysigncorpus.github.io). Still images can be made automatically for publications.
The still images are not always perfect but generally pretty good.
